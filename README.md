# SAO-leash
A leash for shitty-add-ons incase they fall off your main badge. I stole this idea from [av_pubs](https://twitter.com/av_pubs)

Here is what is looks like prior to attaching

And here is what it looks like attached to an SAO. You could directly attach the clasp to the board's hole, to the lanyard, or around the lanyard and back to the leash.

I used two cheap lanyards with lobster clasps, and tied them together at their loop so there is a clasp on each side. If the SAO has a hole you could directly connect the clasp to the SAO, and not need the 3d printed part that sticks to the SAO.

Otherwise use "15mm 3M VHB double-sided sticky round mounting pads" which I could find for about 40 cents each

To find the lanyards look for: "2.56 inch lanyard lobster cellphone clasp" for around 6 cents each. A similar option can be found at this Amazon [link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B1VWPZDJ) (non-affiliate).

If 15mm is too large, a 10mm version has been added. An example of 10mm adhesive dots that work can be found at this Amazon [link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092ZV88CM) (non-affiliate).
